# NarrativeTrace

> Code is the log. Auto-generate human-readable execution traces from method names, parameter names, and return values.

NarrativeTrace is a Java library that eliminates manual logging. It wraps services with tracing proxies (or uses a Java agent) to capture every method call and renders the result as Markdown, prose, diagrams, or JSON. Includes naming clarity analysis that scores code readability.
